## Problem Statement
In today's digital landscape, businesses and individuals rely heavily on cloud computing services to deploy applications, store data, and perform various computing tasks. However, selecting the right cloud region for hosting these services is often a complex and challenging decision, as it involves balancing multiple factors such as latency, cost, and environmental sustainability.
The goal of this project is to develop a web application that simplifies the process of choosing a cloud region by providing users with comprehensive data on latency, pricing, and carbon footprint associated with each region offered by Google Cloud Platform.

## Solved Problems
### 1. Latency Optimization: 
By selecting the Google Cloud region with the lowest latency, the web app helps users improve the speed and responsiveness of their applications and services. This is crucial for ensuring a smooth user experience and reducing delays in data transfer.
### 2. Cost Efficiency:
By considering the pricing of different regions, the project helps users minimize their expenses on cloud services. Selecting a region with lower prices for computing, storage, and other resources can lead to significant cost savings for businesses and individuals alike.
### 3. Environmental Impact Reduction:
By factoring in the carbon footprint associated with each region, the web app promotes environmental sustainability. Users can choose regions that rely on renewable energy sources or have lower overall carbon emissions, contributing to efforts to mitigate climate change and promote eco-friendly practices.
